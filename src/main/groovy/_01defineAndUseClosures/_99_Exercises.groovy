TODO
1. Go through the examples, run each one of them and make sure you understand them
2. See if you can figure out how to make the following methods of list work using closures (See ref link above)
   Make a list for each of the cases like we did in examples and try all of the methods.
  - eachWithIndex(Closure closure)
  - split(Closure closure)
  - toUnique(Closure condition)
  - withDefault(Closure init)
