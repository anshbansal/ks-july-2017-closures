Agenda

We want to start from a point where someone has zero experience in closures to the point where someone can use closures easily and anything in-between.

- Basics of Closure
- Closure coercion
- Closure delegation strategies to create DSLs
- Variables and methods in Closures
- Command chaining
- Command chaining with Closures
- Using Delegation annotations while create DSLs
